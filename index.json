The binary vector denotes the node's membership in one or more communities. At its core, the LFRM is an overlapping stochastic blockmodel, which defines the link probability between any pair of nodes as a bilinear function of their community membership vectors. Moreover, using a nonparametric Bayesian prior (Indian Buffet Process) enables learning the number of communities automatically from the data. However, despite its appealing properties, inference in LFRM remains a challenge and is typically done via MCMC methods. This can be slow and may take a long time to converge. In this work, we develop a small-variance asymptotics based framework for the non-parametric Bayesian LFRM. This leads to an objective function that retains the nonparametric Bayesian flavor of LFRM, while enabling us to design deterministic inference algorithms for this model, that are easy to implement (using generic or specialized optimization routines) and are fast in practice. Our results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithm is competitive to methods such as MCMC, while being much faster.","tags":["Bayesian Statistics"],"title":"Small-variance asymptotics for nonparametric Bayesian overlapping stochastic blockmodels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anupreet Porwal","Sharmishtha Mitra","Amit Mitra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531267200,"objectID":"bae36a4ff5d98e7517af38b156820e4b","permalink":"https://Anupreet-Porwal.github.io/publication/eef-mssp/","publishdate":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/eef-mssp/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we consider the order estimation problem of a 2-dimensional complex superimposed exponential signal model in presence of additive white noise. We use the recently proposed exponentially embedded family (EEF) rule (see Stoica and Babu in IEEE Signal Process Lett 19(9):551–554, 2012; Kay in IEEE Trans Aerosp Electron Syst 41(1):333–345, 2005) for estimating the order of the 2-dimensional signal model and prove that the EEF rule based estimator is consistent in large sample scenario. Extensive simulations are performed to ascertain the performance of the order estimation rule and also to compare the finite sample performance of EEF rule based estimator with other popular order selection rules using simulation examples.","tags":["Statistical Modeling"],"title":"Order estimation of 2-dimensional complex superimposed exponential signal model using exponentially embedded family (EEF) rule: large sample consistency properties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sharmishtha Mitra","Anupreet Porwal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499904000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499904000,"objectID":"a452e0bfa3cbf03d3983fba2dcd5aecd","permalink":"https://Anupreet-Porwal.github.io/publication/pal/","publishdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pal/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently a novel approach of model order selection based on penalizing adaptively the likelihood (PAL) function was introduced in [1]. In this paper, we use the PAL method for order estimation of complex valued nonlinear exponential (cisoid) model and study its asymptotic statistical properties. We investigate the asymptotic statistical properties for the 1-dimensional cisoid model under the assumption of ircularly symmetric gaussian error distribution and establish that the PAL estimator is consistent. We also present simulation examples to compare the performance of PAL rule with the commonly used information criteria based rules.","tags":["Bayesian Statistics"],"title":"Order Estimation of Superimposed Nonlinear Complex Cisoid Model Using Adaptively Penalizing Likelihood Rule: Consistency Results","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://Anupreet-Porwal.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
